# renderers

Programmable chat templates for LLM training and inference. A renderer turns a model's chat template into a Python object that can render messages → token ids, parse completion ids → structured assistant messages, and extend a multi-turn rollout without re-rendering model-sampled history.

Standalone on PyPI, and portable across training and inference stacks (transformers, vLLM, SGLang, Tinker). Initially developed for RL training with [verifiers](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers) and `prime-rl` at Prime Intellect.

## Install

```bash
uv add renderers
```

The base install supports text renderers with a bring-your-own tokenizer. Add
the Hugging Face integration for the tokenizer-loading helpers, or the complete
media stack for image/audio rendering:

```bash
uv add 'renderers[transformers]'
uv add 'renderers[multimodal]'
```

A BYO tokenizer must expose `encode`, `decode`, `convert_tokens_to_ids`, and
token IDs such as `eos_token_id`. Character offsets are optional: tokenizers
supporting `return_offsets_mapping=True` also receive precise per-token
`is_content` attribution; without offsets, renderers return `is_content=[]`.
`DefaultRenderer` additionally requires `apply_chat_template`. This includes
text-only Inkling training: `InklingRenderer` loads its Transformers processor
only when image or audio content is actually rendered.

## At a glance

```python
from renderers import create_renderer
from renderers.base import load_tokenizer

tok = load_tokenizer("Qwen/Qwen3-8B")              # renderers[transformers]
r = create_renderer(tok)                            # → Qwen3Renderer (auto-resolved)

prompt_ids = r.render_ids(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    add_generation_prompt=True,
)
# Feed prompt_ids to a Token-In, Token-Out endpoint.
# It returns completion_ids sampled by the model.

parsed = r.parse_response(completion_ids, prompt_ids=prompt_ids)
# ParsedResponse(content=..., reasoning_content=..., tool_calls=...)
```

Pass the exact sampling `prompt_ids` into `parse_response` to identify reasoning
opened by the generation prompt. Without its closing marker, the sampled text
stays in `reasoning_content`, with empty `content` and no executable tool calls,
even if the engine reports `stop`. This applies to every supported reasoning
format, including Harmony analysis and Gemma's post-tool thought channel.
Omitting `prompt_ids`, passing `None`, and passing `[]` all parse the completion
as self-contained: reasoning needs its own initial opener or channel header.
Generation settings never supply missing parsing context. If the prompt supplied
the opener, pass that prompt; `generate` does this automatically.

For reasoning-first formats, only an initial `<think>` (after any assistant
header) or reasoning already opened in the prompt starts reasoning. After its
first closing marker, the rest is content. Later think markers remain literal
content: `Before<think>example</think>After` is entirely content. Harmony,
Gemma, and Inkling follow their explicit channel or message-segment grammar.

`ParsedResponse.reasoning_complete` is `False` while a reasoning channel is open,
`True` when it is closed (or the format has no reasoning channel), and `None` when
its state cannot be determined. It does not certify tool syntax, normal engine
termination, nonempty final output, or task success. The generate client forwards
this narrow signal and passes prompt context automatically. Custom renderers used
with `generate` should accept `parse_response(..., tools=None, prompt_ids=None)`;
formats that do not need prompt context can ignore it.

Summary consumers should require normal termination (`finish_reason="stop"`),
nonempty final content, and no tool calls. A length-limited final answer remains
truncated even when its reasoning channel is closed. Keep rejected attempts in
usage/training accounting, and replace conversation history only after acceptance.

For the next turn, extend the previous sampled stream instead of re-rendering history:

```python
next_prompt_ids = r.bridge_to_next_turn(
    previous_prompt_ids=prompt_ids,
    previous_completion_ids=completion_ids,
    new_messages=[{"role": "tool", "content": "..."}],
)
```

Hand-coded renderers ship for `qwen3`, `qwen3-vl`, `qwen3.5`, `qwen3.6`, `qwen3.8`, `gemma4`, `glm-5`, `glm-5.1`, `glm-4.5`, `minimax-m2`, `deepseek-v3`, `deepseek-r1`, `deepseek-v4` (V4 Flash 0731), `kimi-k2`, `kimi-k2.5` / `kimi-k2.6`, `laguna-xs.2`, `laguna-xs-2.1`, `laguna-s-2.1`, `laguna-m.1`, `nemotron-3`, `nemotron-3-ultra`, `nemotron-3.5`, `llama-3`, `gpt-oss`, `hy3`, `inkling` / `inkling-small`, and `prime-qwen3`. Anything else falls back to `DefaultRenderer`, a generic `apply_chat_template` wrapper. `qwen3-vl`, `qwen3.5`, `qwen3.6`, `qwen3.8`, `gemma4`, `kimi-k2.5` / `kimi-k2.6`, and the Inkling checkpoints are multimodal (Inkling handles both image **and** audio).

## API

```python
class Renderer(Protocol):
    def render(messages, *, tools=None, add_generation_prompt=False) -> RenderedTokens: ...
    def render_ids(messages, *, tools=None, add_generation_prompt=False) -> list[int]: ...
    def parse_response(token_ids) -> ParsedResponse: ...
    def get_stop_token_ids() -> list[int]: ...
    def bridge_to_next_turn(prev_prompt_ids, prev_completion_ids, new_messages, *, tools=None) -> list[int] | None: ...
```

- `RenderedTokens` carries `token_ids` **and** `message_indices` — one entry per token attributing each to its source message (`-1` for structural scaffolding). Lets `build_training_sample` build a per-token loss mask in one render.
- `ParsedResponse` is `(content, reasoning_content, tool_calls)`. It scans token ids for special-token boundaries (e.g. id `151657` for `<tool_call>` on Qwen3) — a literal `"<tool_call>"` in user content tokenizes to ordinary text ids and never matches.
- Round-trip: rendering `[user, assistant(content, reasoning, tool_calls)]`, slicing the assistant completion, and feeding it through `parse_response` returns an equivalent structured message. Tested per-renderer in `tests/test_roundtrip.py`.
- Gemma 4 renders visible content on a tool-calling assistant message before its calls, where a sampled turn has it (generation halts at `<|tool_response>`), and, when that turn is the last message, leaves the turn open after the folded tool responses: the model is mid-turn and the next render continues it. Google's template moves the content after the responses and closes the turn with `<turn|>` ([HF discussion #115](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-31B-it/discussions/115)); re-rendering that way would rewrite sampled history and put a turn close where the model is still mid-turn. Legacy `tool_responses` messages keep the template's placement.

### `bridge_to_next_turn` (the core contract)

Given `(prev_prompt_ids, prev_completion_ids)` and new environment messages, return ids for the next turn's prompt such that the result starts with `prev_prompt_ids + prev_completion_ids` byte-for-byte and continues with the new messages plus the next assistant opener. If that cannot be proven safe, return `None` and the caller falls back to a full render.

Each hand-coded bridge:
1. Checks the previous turn's reasoning state. If reasoning is unfinished and no stop was sampled, append its closing marker as non-loss prompt context before the canonical turn close. If a stop was already sampled inside reasoning, return `None`: inserting a close before it would violate the exact-prefix contract. Parsing never repairs the sampled output.
2. Anchors at the previous turn's canonical close token. On clean stops it's already in `prev_completion_ids`. On truncation, the renderer synthesizes the close as non-loss prompt context.
3. Refuses assistant content in `new_messages` — re-rendering sampled tokens would replace them with canonical template bytes.
4. Renders only the new messages in the framing the model family expects.

`DefaultRenderer.bridge_to_next_turn` returns `None` unconditionally — the template's close is unknown, so the contract can't be proven.

### Picking a renderer

```python
r = create_renderer(tok)                # AutoRendererConfig is the implicit default
```

Auto-detect matches `tokenizer.name_or_path` against `MODEL_RENDERER_MAP` by **exact match**. Prefix matching is intentionally off — same architecture can ship different chat templates (base vs instruct, fine-tune renames). Fine-tunes must pass an explicit typed config (e.g. `Qwen3RendererConfig()`). Unknown text-only names fall back to `DefaultRenderer`, unless `AutoRendererConfig(thinking_retention=...)` was set; the default renderer cannot implement that bridge policy.

Without the `transformers` extra, exact-match registered models still
auto-resolve. For an unknown name, renderers cannot safely probe `AutoConfig`
to distinguish a text model from an unknown VLM; pass an explicit typed config
such as `DefaultRendererConfig()` for a known text-only model.

## Why use a renderer

For RL the trainer must see the exact token ids the sampler saw. The standard alternative — let the inference engine apply the chat template, parse tool calls, parse reasoning, and re-render full history every turn — silently breaks token identity. These are the failure modes a renderer's `bridge_to_next_turn` sidesteps by never re-rendering prior turns:

- **Boolean round-trip.** Engine emits `false`; client parses to Python `bool(False)`; `apply_chat_template` re-renders via `str(False)` → `"False"`. Capital F. Reproducible on Qwen3.5-35B-A3B + mini-swe-agent-plus at ~50% break rate per rollout.
- **BPE retokenization drift.** The same substring tokenizes differently depending on neighbouring bytes. `json` + `p` + `enderer` (3 tokens) vs `jsonp` + `enderer` (2 tokens) when whitespace shifts by one character. Every subsequent token is shifted from there on.
- **Tool-call XML drift.** The engine emits a no-arg call with a stylistic empty `</parameter>`; the Jinja re-render of the reconstructed dict drops it. Extension property broken at every such call.
- **Max-seq-len truncation zeroing the anchor.** Client-side `max_seq_len` enforcement zeros `completion_ids` when `prompt_len > max_seq_len`. The bridge anchor is empty, falling back to full re-render — triggering every mode above.
- **Scaffold-level history rewriting.** Some agent scaffolds (e.g. opencode's `experimental_repairToolCall`) rewrite tool calls before sending them back as history. The next turn's prompt contains a tool call the model never emitted. *A renderer cannot fix this — the drift happens before rendering.*

Empirical delta on Qwen3.5-35B-A3B + mini-swe-agent-plus, step 0:

| client path                            | breaks | training samples from 64 rollouts |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `apply_chat_template` (full re-render) | 32     | 77                                |
| renderers `bridge_to_next_turn`        | 0      | 64                                |

Each break fragments a rollout into multiple training samples — every fragment re-encodes its prefix, inflating compute roughly linearly with the number of breaks.

## Typed renderer configs

Each renderer accepts a typed pydantic config at construction. Some fields mirror chat-template kwargs; others configure renderer-only behavior such as image caching, parsers, or Harmony preamble construction. `create_renderer` takes one positional `config` argument and an optional keyword-only `chat_template_kwargs` mapping:

```python
from renderers import (
    create_renderer,
    AutoRendererConfig,
    Qwen3RendererConfig,
    GLM5RendererConfig,
    DefaultRendererConfig,
)

# Auto-resolve renderer from the tokenizer's model name.
renderer = create_renderer(tokenizer)
renderer = create_renderer(tokenizer, AutoRendererConfig(thinking_retention="all"))
renderer = create_renderer(
    tokenizer,
    chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": False},
)

# Explicit choice — use the renderer-specific fields it exposes.
renderer = create_renderer(tokenizer, Qwen3RendererConfig(enable_thinking=False))
renderer = create_renderer(tokenizer, GLM5RendererConfig(clear_thinking=False))

# Default renderer (apply_chat_template fallback) — extra fields are
# captured via pydantic ``extra="allow"`` and forwarded to the Jinja
# template; tool / reasoning parsers are typed.
renderer = create_renderer(
    tokenizer,
    DefaultRendererConfig(tool_parser="qwen3", reasoning_parser="think"),
)
```

Discriminated union: every per-renderer config is a variant of `RendererConfig`, dispatched on the `name` field. Bogus combinations (e.g. `add_vision_id` under `name="qwen3"`) error at construction with a `pydantic.ValidationError`. Downstream pydantic configs (prime-rl orchestrator, verifiers `ClientConfig`) hold a single field typed as `RendererConfig` and inherit the same strict-per-variant validation.

When `chat_template_kwargs` is passed with `config=None` / `AutoRendererConfig`, renderers first resolves the concrete renderer from the model name, then validates each key against that renderer's explicit template-kwarg allowlist. Renderer-only fields such as `image_cache_max` must be passed through the typed config instead. `Auto + unknown model + chat_template_kwargs` fails loudly; use an explicit typed config or explicit `DefaultRendererConfig` for opaque fallback templates.

One shared behaviour flag lives on typed renderer configs: `thinking_retention`, an optional bridge-policy override. Leave it unset to derive bridge behaviour from the chat template and its renderer-exposed kwargs.

- `thinking_retention=None` (default) — derive from the chat template / renderer kwargs.
- `thinking_retention="tool_cycle"` — bridge within the in-flight tool cycle; a new user query falls back to a full re-render.
- `thinking_retention="all"` — bridge across user-query boundaries when the bridge is otherwise structurally valid.

Generic `thinking_retention` does **not** change full `render()` output: a full re-render always follows the Python chat-template implementation. Only real template knobs can change full-render thinking behaviour. GLM-5 `clear_thinking=False`, Nemotron-3 `truncate_history_thinking=False`, Qwen3.6 `preserve_thinking=True`, and GPT-OSS `auto_drop_analysis=False` all imply bridge policy `"all"`. Renderers whose templates render no historical reasoning when generation-time thinking is off (GLM-4.5, Kimi K2.5/2.6, Nemotron-3, Gemma 4) derive `"all"` from `enable_thinking=False`. Gemma 4 `preserve_thinking=True` keeps reasoning on historical tool-call turns only, so it does not widen the bridge policy. Setting a direct keep/drop template knob (`preserve_thinking`, `clear_thinking`, `auto_drop_analysis`, `truncate_history_thinking`) and a contradictory `thinking_retention` raises at config-load in either direction. Where `"all"` is derived from a generation-mode knob instead (`enable_thinking` / `thinking`), narrowing to `"tool_cycle"` is accepted as a conservative override; Gemma 4 additionally rejects `enable_thinking=True` with `thinking_retention="all"`, because its template strips reasoning at user queries. The full per-renderer mapping lives in [`docs/renderer-config.md`](docs/renderer-config.md).

## `DefaultRenderer`

Fallback for unsupported text-only models. Wraps `apply_chat_template` and accepts `tool_parser` / `reasoning_parser` (vLLM convention) plus arbitrary Jinja kwargs via `DefaultRendererConfig`'s `extra="allow"`. Explicit `thinking_retention` is rejected: `bridge_to_next_turn` returns `None` because the template's close is unknown, so multi-turn rollouts fall back to full re-render. Implementing a hand-coded renderer is a few hundred lines of Python (`render_ids` + `parse_response` + `bridge_to_next_turn`) and is the only path that closes the failure modes above by construction.

## Roadmap

- **VLM expansion.** `ImagePart` support exists for Qwen3-VL, Qwen3.5-family, Gemma 4, and Kimi K2.5 / K2.6 multimodal templates. Install `renderers[multimodal]` for Pillow and the Hugging Face processors. Remaining work: audio/video support, broader VLM coverage, and more RL validation. Gemma 4 image preprocessing requires a Transformers release that provides `Gemma4Processor`.
- **Patched chat templates.** Some shipped templates re-tokenize history or normalize JSON in ways that break token identity. Plan: a `use_patched` opt-in per renderer that renders the same surface form while avoiding known-bad patterns. (Auto-stripping thinking from past turns is *not* one of these — that's intended template behaviour the renderer reproduces; use `thinking_retention` to override it.)

## Testing

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
```

Round-trip parity (render → parse → original) and token-level parity against each model's independent reference encoder are tested per renderer. Most references use `apply_chat_template`; DeepSeek V4 uses its shipped Python encoder, and GPT-OSS uses Harmony.
